## Responsive Web Design - Cat Photo App

The *Cat Photo App* is the first course that I finished in the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) curriculum offered by Free Code Camp.

Each folder number  corresponds to a very small step down the road.
